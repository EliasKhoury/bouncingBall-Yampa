# bouncingBall-Yampa

The product of playing around with haskell for a few days.

I think I messed up my signal functions because it only responds to the first instance of user input.

making a sandbox and then running cabal install should get it working.

the ball bounces reeeeeaaaaaaly slowly, you can click on the screen to move it but clicking only works once.
